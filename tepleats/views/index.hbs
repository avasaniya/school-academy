                <p class="peregra2">This is the creative, interactive process where we sit with you to get an in-depth understanding of
                    your needs. We translate these needs to a technical solution. During and after development we keep
                    on monitoring if needs change and if the solution keeps delivering. If not, we suggest changes.</p>

                <p class="peregra2">Development is the process of implementing the system design. We believe in an organic agile
                    approach. We continuously do (unit) testing and we involve our clients intensively during the
                    implementation process, allowing for adjustments that improve the end result.</p>

                <p class="peregra2">Every web application needs a reliable environment available on the internet to be able to
                    deliver. Too often we have had to fix sites that were hacked and servers that kept failing.
                    Hence we decided to build our own extremely relaible and secure cloud environment to host our
                    clients' applications.</p>

                    deployment is static. However well built, like with a car, if you don't service, in the end it
                    will break. DITS will always support whatever it built however long ago it was built.</p>
